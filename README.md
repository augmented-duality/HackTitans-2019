### Motivation
This app is a 10x better implementation of Yelp + Google Trips as none offer the product line that this
product offers. The app makes money from day one and is thus profitable and can be scaled without any
outside investments.
The app that does everything from planning trip into the time slots available
including predicting the amount of time spent at restaurants, etc to location based mapping (Using MapMyIndia
which is more advanced than Google Maps API) to booking rides and third party client onboarding offers.

### Project Description
The smart itinerary recommends a trip for users based on their location and the available time for their travel.
The datasets used include Kaggleâ€™s Yelp reviews dataset which maps user reviews and behaiour analytics
into an embedding end-point which is what our AI model learns.
This AI recommender is improved using matrix corellations over traditional collaborative filtering as it is
more effective and state of the art. The real world application is for travellers with minimum time on their
hands who wish to get an entire app that does everything from planning trip into the time slots available
including predicting the amount of time spent at restaurants, etc to location based mapping (Using MapMyIndia
which is more advanced than Google Maps API) to booking rides and third party client onboarding offers.
