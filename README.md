# Human Emotion Recognition from Speech 

## Motivation and Idea
Usually in TV shows some person will be playing background song(s) . He/She takes decison based on the topic being discussed in the room(say) . He plays songs of his own choice . The person need to be little knowledgeable to do this task . But being a human he / she might makes mistakes and needs better experience to lean .
My idea is to automate this process. So this application `plays` the `_songs_` based on the __emotions in the speech__ .
I have 4 classes 
* 1. Neutral
* 2. Angry
* 3. Happy
* 4. Sad
